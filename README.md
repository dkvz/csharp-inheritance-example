# Problems
- C# conventions: GetDescription should be called Speak or something, "Get" implies this should be a Property instead.

# TODO 
We can also override ToString at some point.
-> Find methods that do use ToString and expect it to be overriden.
-> We could just use a list of object in the Farm class and call ToString, that would be the ultimate generification.
